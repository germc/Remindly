# Remindly

The quickest way to create a reminder on your iPhoneâ„¢.  It starts up quickly, allows you to scribble a letter, word, or figure on the screen, enter a time (with convienent shortcuts) and then get on with your day. 

## Features:
 * Enter a reminder in just a few seconds
 * Uses the UILocalNotification features found in iOs 4.0, allowing reminders to continue to fire even if Remindly isn't running
 * Created by IoGee
 * Inspired by Palm application Diddlebug.

## Source code includes:
 * Bezier curves for smoothing lines while drawing.  Many drawing apps don't seem to do this, they really should.
 * Background locaiton updates which fire geographical alarms when leaving or nearing a location
 * Xibless design with application created only in code.
 * Uses in-app purchase, a good reference for a often-confusing subject.  When building for yourself, you probably want to modify method -(BOOL)isAllowedMoreNotes in  
[NotesManager.m](https://github.com/nathanstitt/Remindly/blob/master/Classes/NotesManager.m) to always return true.
